    "At the beginning of the game, the game software randomly generates 5 numbers in the range of 10000 to 20000, but those that are initially divisible by both 3 and 2. The human-player chooses which of the generated numbers he wants to start the game with. \n",

    "he number chosen by the human-player is given. Both players have 0 points. In addition, the game uses a game bank, which is initially equal to 0. Players make consecutive moves, dividing the current number by 2 or 3 in each move. The number can be divided only if the result is a whole number. If the division results in an even number, then the player gets 1 point, if the number is odd, then his points are reduced by 1 point. On the other hand, if a number ending with 0 or 5 is obtained, then 1 point is added to the bank. The game ends when the number 2 or 3 is acquired. The player after whose turn the number 2 is acquired empties the bank by adding bank points to his points. The player with the higher number of points at the end of the game wins. If the number of points is equal, then the result is a draw."
